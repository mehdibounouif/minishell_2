When a command terminates on a fatal signal whose number is N, Bash uses the value
128+N as the exit status.
If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of
127. If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.
If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status
is greater than zero.

The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command in the pipeline, unless
the pipefail option is enabled (see Section 4.3.1 [The Set Builtin], page 74). If pipefail
is enabled, the pipeline’s return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit
with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully. If the reserved word ‘!’
precedes the pipeline, the exit status is the logical negation of the exit status as described

child return:
command F_OK not found return (127)
command X_OK not executuble return (126)

lstat() :
Does not follow the symlink.
Returns information about the link itself, not the target.

stat() :
Follows the symlink to the target file.
Returns information about file.txt, not link.txt.

A symbolic link (symlink) is like a shortcut to another file or directory.
It is a special file that points to another file or directory.
When you access the symlink, you're actually accessing the file it points to.


ln -s file.txt link.txt
This creates a symlink called link.txt that points to file.txt.

What is a Bitmask?
A bitmask is a value (usually an integer) where each bit(0 or 1) 
has a specific meaning—typically 
used to store multiple true/false flags in a single variable.
